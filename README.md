Objective:

The notebook aims to analyse fuel performance metrics using the relevant dataset. It is a regression data having 15 features and one dependent variable target3

Conclusions:

The analysis reveals that the Adaboost model demonstrated the best performance among the tested models, with an R-squared score of 0.1782.
This indicates a modest relationship between the features and the target variable, suggesting potential for further optimization.
